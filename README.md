# Rails Dummy App

Rails Dummy App and test_helper.rb for testing gems 

## The Files

- Dummy app is in `test/dummy_app` copy this into your `test` or `spec` folder
- `test/test_helper.rb` contains some test setup, by default uses minitest, can easily switch to rspec
- `.gitignore` contains some useful ignores
- `Gemfile` for the dependencies, I prefer to just use `Gemfile` instead of the `gemspec` for development dependencies
